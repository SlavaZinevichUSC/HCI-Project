# Multi-Modal Machine Learning for Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on the application of multi-modal machine learning techniques to extract facial expressions from images while mitigating bias against protected groups. The aim is to develop a system capable of accurately recognizing facial expressions across diverse demographic groups, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in the recognition process.

## Motivation
Facial expression recognition systems often suffer from biases, leading to inaccurate or unfair predictions, especially when deployed in diverse populations. This project seeks to address these issues by leveraging multi-modal machine learning approaches, which integrate information from multiple sources (such as images, audio, and text) to improve accuracy and mitigate biases.

## Key Objectives
- **Facial Expression Recognition**: Develop models capable of accurately recognizing facial expressions from images.
- **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrate information from multiple modalities (e.g., images, audio) to enhance recognition performance.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Implement techniques to mitigate biases against protected groups, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in the recognition process.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Define appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance and fairness.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of facial images annotated with expressions, ensuring representation across different demographic groups.
2. **Pre-processing**: Pre-process the data to ensure consistency and quality, including face detection, alignment, and normalization.
3. **Model Development**: Develop multi-modal machine learning models capable of integrating information from various modalities (e.g., images, audio) for facial expression recognition.
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Implement techniques such as adversarial training, fairness constraints, or bias-aware loss functions to mitigate biases against protected groups.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics, including accuracy, fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact, equalized odds), and qualitative assessments.
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Iterate on model development and evaluation based on feedback and insights gained during the process.

## Future Directions
- **Fine-Grained Analysis**: Conduct a fine-grained analysis of biases to better understand their sources and implications.
- **Fairness-Aware Training**: Explore advanced fairness-aware training techniques to further mitigate biases and ensure fairness.
- **Real-World Deployment**: Investigate the deployment of the developed models in real-world scenarios, considering ethical and regulatory considerations.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the robustness and generalization of the developed models over time and across different contexts.
